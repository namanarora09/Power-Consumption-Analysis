# Power Consumption analysis

This repository is a part of data science externship by SmartBridge powered by IBM and this repository contains the project that I developed. 

In this project, the data is given for the power consumption of various houses and many other factors on which the power consumption depends on. The Machine learning model in this project uses multilinear regression to predict the power consumption of any house for which the model has not seen this data before.
